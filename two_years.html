Not gonna lie — my time as a data scientist has been pretty awesome. I was technically on a product team at Microsoft in DevDiv working on improving developer tools like VS Code, but in practice it was like a flush research job with tons of freedom (to first approximation my instructions for the first six months were, &quot;Fix bugs using machine learning. Go.&quot;)  I got to work with cutting edge transformer models and their application to source code, the most famous of which is autocompletion ala intellisense, tabnine, and Codex. Every two months the amount of compute I have access to has doubled, starting out with a 2013 macbook air and ending with a cluster with thousands of A100s (which, to be fair, I share with more people than my old laptop), and I got to collaborate on ten different papers. </p><p id="7e0eb09e-1628-400e-911c-23a944929b1f" class="">I was extremely green when I started out. I hadn&#x27;t used python since cs1 as a college freshman, excluding one month where I worked through <a href="http://fast.ai">fast.ai</a> and leetcode. Maybe the most telling anecdote is that I spent an embarrassingly long time using vim as my exclusive file editor... while not knowing <em>any</em> of the vim shortcuts besides :wq (write and quit). </p><figure id="29d24fa1-aaa4-4a53-9554-259a522056f3" class="image"><a href="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/hoping_for_interview_questions_o_rly.jpg"><img style="width:914px" src="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/hoping_for_interview_questions_o_rly.jpg"/></a></figure><p id="feff33cd-87d4-495c-adbb-04403b625dc8" class="">Since then I&#x27;ve become much more competent, in python, on the command line, as a member of a software engineering team, and as a machine learning researcher, and I wanted to share some of the things that I&#x27;ve learned along the way.</p><h3 id="491af620-554f-4453-80c4-827314d65e8f" class="">Python</h3><p id="580f39c2-a46a-49b8-8097-6952fa1e5dd5" class="">Python is the language of data science.

Notebooks are a type of repl (read-eval-print loop, see <a href="https://replit.com/">https://replit.com/</a> for repl&#x27;s in many different languages), which allow for extremely fast iterative development. An old school development process typically involves rerunning an entire file over and over again each time you make a change. A notebook or repl however <em>maintains state</em>, so you can define the input variables once and then simply execute the lines that you&#x27;re truly interested in.</p><p id="a9078214-7918-4474-9324-332e9d06a097" class="">Notebooks also enable some amazing tutorials and documentation, since you can interleave markdown, graphs, and executable code snippets in a notebook.

I think there are a couple reasons for this. First because I was coming from a math background, where I felt like the hard work should be understanding the problem, and that actually writing the code should be as simple as writing down the solution to a problem after you&#x27;ve solved it. Second because I was a noob and would get stuck on frustratingly simple things as well as common gotchas for a long time. Third because I&#x27;m pretty sure I would attempt to write the entire program in one fell swoop and then painfully spend the next hour patching it up, rather than add functionality more incrementally like you do in a notebook.

But to <em>really</em> see what&#x27;s going on, you can insert a breakpoint <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code>, say after the line where my_list is defined. The program will run until your breakpoint, and then give you control. You can then inspect everything, e.g. <code>p my_list</code>, <code>p sorted(my_list)</code> etc. You can also execute arbitrary code, such as defining new variables like <code>other_list = sorted(my_list)</code>. You can also use the commands <code>u</code> and <code>d</code> (for up and down) to navigate the call stack, which in this case would just have two frames: the highest-level frame which call bad_fun, and the deeper frame which actually sets my_list. Finally, you can continue executing the program you&#x27;ve interrupted using the commands for next (execute until the next line in the file), step (execute the next line in the program (which might mean going deeper into thecall stack), and continue (run the whole program, at least up until the next breakpoint). </p><p id="e2bfe642-d782-4089-b974-d16c9b1ad1ec" class="">pdb plays poorly with multiprocessing (by default <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code> will simply crash your program if its inside a child process you&#x27;ve spawned using multiprocessing.pool.Pool, so I always implement my programs with a single worker first before parallelizing.</p><p id="5669909d-9c51-4149-a60a-e9b1ad1826f2" class="">One large class of buggy or otherwise subpar programs is code that is too slow.

Note that this will also confuse <em>the IDE</em>, which won&#x27;t be able to provide good goto or autocompletion support. The fix for this is pretty great, though. The first rule is to use type hints, like <code>from typing import List; cars: List[str] = []</code>. (In general these type hints are merely suggestions though, and won&#x27;t actually be enforced.)

The solution is to add your project&#x27;s folder to one of the directories on the PYTHONPATH (what sys.path shows).

You read just the parts of a file that satisfy a regex by doing cat my_file.txt | grep my_regex (the vertical line is pronounced &#x27;pipe&#x27; and lets you chain together commands.) You can copy files using cp and its big brother rsync (which is very useful for updating data across a network, as it both automatically compresses and only sends the diff), move files with mv, delete them with rm and troll your friends with rm -rf (force-deletes everything recursively!!). You can see how your storage is being used with du or df -h, and see how much memory is being used with free -h. You can check on what processes are currently running with (h)top or ps -axf. watch is useful for continuously running a command, e.g. watch -n1 nvidia-smi will show you the output of nvidia-smi every second. You can edit files with vim if you must. Once in vim, the most important command is :q. You can see your command history using history (history | grep cmd is pretty helpful). One of the most important commands is ssh, which allows you to control a (typically more powerful) computer remotely from your laptop. You can also forward ports so that you can locally see the remote machine&#x27;s <a href="http://localhost/8080">localhost/</a>6006 or whatever.</p><p id="862421c6-2d60-4719-aa81-b96207afd405" class="">Arguably the most important command is python ;), which calls a python script or, if used without an argument, starts a python session (you can also use ipython, which is slightly better for interactive command line sessions), there&#x27;s also the command bash for executing shell scripts.</p><p id="558ec341-f039-4433-8858-6d03596a77a5" class="">You can run run processes in parallel using cmd1 &amp; cmd2, or in sequence using cmd1 &amp;&amp; cmd2.

The real magic of git is that it allows a team of collaborators to simultaneously edit a repo. GitHub (and also azure devops!) allows for storing a remote repo, to which updates are periodically pushed, and which collaborators can clone and then keep updated by pulling new code. To make simultaneous edits, collaborators typically work on different branches from the main (or master) branch, like &#x27;dawn/improve-parsing&#x27;, which are periodically merged into the main branch via a pull request after being pushed to GithHub. The initiation of a pull request is a natural point for code review. Often there&#x27;s a somewhat painful step after attempting to pull or merge where the developer has to open an editor and resolve merge conflicts from simultaneous edits to the same code block that can&#x27;t be automatically stacked with each other.</p><p id="e132bb21-2527-41eb-906a-0ecb4854bf71" class="">It&#x27;s a lot of jargon (repo, clone, branch, commit, pull, push, merge, pull request (pr), as well as diff, merge conflict, not to mention add, commit message, checkout etc.).

It clarified visual vs. insert vs. normal mode for me, how to find and replace, delete a line, highlight text and copy and paste etc. It&#x27;s brilliantly interactive.</p><figure id="bef35a19-df7e-47a2-8d76-21736aa3f22c" class="image"><a href="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/exiting_vim_o_rly.jpg"><img style="width:914px" src="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/exiting_vim_o_rly.jpg"/></a></figure><h3 id="89624cc4-f266-4a8e-87fd-c53a6e089684" class="">Gear (loosely construed)</h3><p id="b488b5a9-e8f6-499c-81a2-9bf2224b6c77" class="">I spend about eight hours a day wearing these godly noise-canceling headphones from Sony, which just two years ago cost $300 and now are as cheap as $100 on ebay <a href="https://www.ebay.com/p/17023331317?thm=2000">https://www.ebay.com/p/17023331317?thm=2000</a>. The one day I forgot to bring them to work, I was so overwhelmed by all the office noise that I grabbed a stack of papers and spent the entire day camped out in a different room. I keep an extra pair downstairs in addition to the one in my home office, just so that I can don them on short notice if I want to work on a problem or tune someone out. I also have spotify premium to complement my headphones.</p><p id="5cacf56b-9bfb-4fbf-a670-ba913721752f" class="">I spent most of my adolescence addicted to various computer games and websites, which I will refrain from naming here out of respect for info hazards. I FINALLY solved this lifelong problem my first year at Microsoft by paying a token $50 or so for the program FocusMe, which does a very robust job of blocking any site I tell it to. Another premium option is RescueTime, which additionally provides excellent fine-grained time-tracking (essential for doing any kind of life-hacking experiments, although Apple&#x27;s default Screen Time is already pretty good). There are also free browser extensions like leechblock which do a similar job, albeit with more trivial workarounds. I also have special tricks for important websites that I still want to access, but simply in a less addicting way. Specifically I have FaceBook Newsfeed Eradicator, and I use ublock origin to block the comments and video recommendations on YouTube, see <a href="https://github.com/JesseDrain/Less-Addictive-YouTube">https://github.com/JesseDrain/Less-Addictive-YouTube</a>. Another small trick for avoiding distraction is to keep my phone out of sight, literally a foot away, but buried under a sweater or pillow so that it&#x27;s effectively invisible.</p><figure id="711d1345-4271-40cf-9c5f-ea4a78f22e2e" class="image"><a href="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/procrastination_o_rly.png"><img style="width:500px" src="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/procrastination_o_rly.png"/></a></figure><p id="7576b332-5862-4245-b30f-acc231ea6162" class="">I have this awesome monitor 43&quot; (tv) 4k monitor which I got from amazon for $300 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-43S425-Inch-Ultra-Smart/dp/B07DK5PZFY">https://www.amazon.com/TCL-43S425-Inch-Ultra-Smart/dp/B07DK5PZFY</a>, a steal compared to the price of a comparable monitor marketed specifically for computers rather than as a tv. I turned it vertically (resting it against the wall...) and can fit over 300 vertical lines of code :), and I can comfortably fit 600 LOC if I split screen. Remarkably it only weights fifteen pounds. The main downside is that it won&#x27;t fit in a suitcase and is expensive to ship. Also I can get kind of enraged when reduced to 20 LOC on my laptop...</p><p id="15fb959d-11f5-4cff-baeb-fe207bd568c1" class="">I also have these extremely bright 60W cornbulb LED lights, which give my third-floor office a kind of mad scientist vibe when viewed from the street. They&#x27;re especially good at combating 5pm winter sunsets. I also have a personal fan, which helps with those 110 degree Seattle afternoons we apparently get now oh my god global warming is real, as well as an air purifier for when the world is on fire.</p><p id="e9475397-0dc8-4ce0-8b06-bc675bdb2d98" class="">Stimulants like caffeine, adderall, and modafinil are magic. If I could always be on stimulants without developing tolerance I... would be like 2-3x as productive and 20% happier. It&#x27;s this one dollar pill and then you get like an extra five hours of highly engrossing work. People <em>do</em> stay on adderall and modafinil indefinitely while at least reporting only partial or no tolerance (see section four here <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/28/adderall-risks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/28/adderall-risks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/</a>, and the penultimate section <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/16/nootropics-survey-results-and-analysis/">https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/16/nootropics-survey-results-and-analysis/</a> (personally I feel like people develop tolerance to caffeine very quickly than to adderall and modafinil)). But, well, I still want to have some more long-term tracking data from RescueTime and Screen Time before I personally start taking these drugs on anything like a daily basis.</p><figure id="24b5e226-40ab-460f-9e17-857d7177b326" class="image"><a href="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/drugs_o_rly.jpg"><img style="width:236px" src="Lessons%20Learned%20from%20two%20years%20as%20a%20Data%20Scientist%2029d24fa1aaa44a539554259a522056f3/drugs_o_rly.jpg"/></a></figure><h3 id="5a18000a-d5a7-4754-a6f5-c9eaf01b53dc" class="">Shortcuts</h3><p id="b959b1c7-6255-41ed-8329-80e326b8b019" class="">
